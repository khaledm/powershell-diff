# PowerShell XML Diff Analysis Constitution

<!--
Sync Impact Report v1.0.0
- Initial version creation
- Added 5 core principles aligned with XML diff analysis requirements
- Added sections for Quality Standards and Development Workflow
- All templates require initial setup (âš  pending)
- No deferred placeholders
-->

## Core Principles

### I. XML Response Integrity
All XML response handling must preserve the complete structure and content of the original data. No data transformation allowed during the collection phase to maintain source truth.

### II. Deterministic Diff Analysis
Diff analysis must be deterministic and reproducible. Same input must always produce identical diff results. All diff operations must be documented and version controlled. Machine-readable output format is mandatory for automation support.

### III. Comprehensive Comparison
Diff analysis must cover all aspects of XML structure: elements, attributes, values, and hierarchical relationships. Comparison must track:
- Element presence/absence
- Value changes
- Attribute modifications
- Structural differences
- Order changes (where significant)

### IV. Error Handling & Validation
Robust error handling is mandatory at every step:
- Web service connection failures
- XML parsing errors
- Schema validation issues
- Diff analysis exceptions
All errors must be categorized and provide actionable context for resolution.

### V. Output Standards
Diff reports must be:
- Machine-readable (structured format)
- Human-readable (clear formatting)
- Categorized by change type
- Include metadata (timestamp, service versions, request context)
- Support multiple output formats (XML, JSON, HTML)

## Quality Standards

- All code must be tested with unit tests covering core diff logic
- Integration tests must verify end-to-end workflow with sample data
- Performance benchmarks required for large XML comparisons
- Memory usage must be optimized for large documents
- Code must follow PowerShell best practices and style guidelines

## Development Workflow

1. Script Development:
   - Modular function design
   - Clear parameter validation
   - Proper error handling implementation
   - Documentation with examples
   
2. Testing Requirements:
   - Pester tests (unit tests) for diff logic

3. Review Process:
   - Code review focusing on algorithm correctness
   - Test coverage verification
   - Performance analysis
   - Error handling validation

## Governance

1. Constitution compliance is mandatory for all code changes
2. Major version updates require:
   - Full test suite passing
   - Performance benchmark review
   - Documentation updates
   - Migration guide if breaking changes
3. Regular audits of diff accuracy against known test cases
4. Performance monitoring and optimization as needed
