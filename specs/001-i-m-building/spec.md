# Feature Specification: Machine-Readable Diff Analysis for XML Webservice Responses

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-m-building`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Complete
**Input**: User description: "I'm building a Powershell 7+ script to be able to perform  Machine-Readable Diff Analysis on XML webservice responses from two web services I've built, namely Service-PoC and Service-NonPoC. They make calles to two instances  (one new, one old) of the same 3rd party Insurance Quote generating service. I would like the powershell script to make two calls to both the Service-PoC and Service-NonPoC endpoints. The service calls should use the same request payload XML. This powershell should be able to verify the outcomes of the service calls (are they successful or not, is there a response XML paylaod, can this response payload be turn into XML object for Machine-Readable Diff Analysis). The responses then should be analysed using Machine-Readable Diff Analysis techniques. The outcomes should be presented to the users in a human readable format (HTML)."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user provides a single XML request payload. The system sends this payload to both Service-PoC and Service-NonPoC endpoints. The system verifies both calls succeed, both responses are valid XML, and then performs a machine-readable diff analysis of the two XML responses. The user receives a human-readable (HTML) report of the differences.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid XML request, **When** both services respond successfully, **Then** the user receives an HTML diff report highlighting all differences between the two XML responses.
2. **Given** a valid XML request, **When** one or both services fail to respond or return invalid XML, **Then** the user is notified of the error and no diff is performed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when one service is unavailable or times out? (Service calls timeout after 120 seconds)
- How does the system handle malformed or empty XML responses?
- What if the XML responses are identical?
- How are large or deeply nested XML documents handled? (Up to 10MB per document)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a single XML request payload from the user.
- **FR-002**: System MUST send the same request to both Service-PoC and Service-NonPoC endpoints.
- **FR-003**: System MUST verify that both service calls succeed and return well-formed XML (no schema validation required).
- **FR-004**: System MUST parse both responses into XML objects for analysis.
- **FR-005**: System MUST perform a machine-readable diff analysis of the two XML responses, identifying all differences in elements, attributes, and values.
- **FR-006**: System MUST present the diff results in a human-readable HTML report.
- **FR-007**: System MUST immediately abort with an error message if either service call fails or returns invalid XML.
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle XML documents up to 10MB in size and complete diff analysis within 3 minutes (excluding service call time).
- **FR-009**: System SHOULD log errors and key events for troubleshooting.
- **FR-010**: System SHOULD allow for future extension to support additional output formats (e.g., JSON).

### Key Entities
- **XML Request Payload**: The user-supplied XML document sent to both services.
- **Service Response**: The XML response returned by each service endpoint.
- **Diff Report**: The structured, human-readable (HTML) output summarizing all detected differences.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
